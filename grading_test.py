# This script computes grades for CSE101 students. It only gives an "approximate" grade, since the plus/minus
# boundary is not yet decided.
# 
# USAGE: python3 grading-for-students.py
# OUTPUT: Approximate grade, printed to console.
# 
# It will prompt the student to enter grades (through the console) for the tests and for the HWs.
# 
# The output grade is printed out to the console, and is computed based on a simple decision tree.
